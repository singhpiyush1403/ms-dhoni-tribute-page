    <h2>
        Good morning everyone!
Today, I am going to speak about one of India’s greatest cricketers – Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
He was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand.
MS Dhoni is known as "Captain Cool" for his calm and composed personality.
He led India to victory in the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy.
Dhoni is one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket.
He is also an excellent wicketkeeper and a powerful finisher in the game.
Even after retirement, he continues to inspire millions with his humility and dedication.
Apart from cricket, he is also a Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army.
MS Dhoni is a true legend and a role model for youth across the country.
